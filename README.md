# WhatsApp message statistics between me and a friend.
Most of the code here is pretty bad but it was done in a couple days and it's only public so I can host it on github. Don't expect anything. At all.

## Tools used
To extract the data from the WhatsApp chat:
- WhatsApp Key Database Extractor: https://github.com/YuvrajRaghuvanshiS/WhatsApp-Key-Database-Extractor
- To format the chat into a JSON I can process: https://andreas-mausch.de/whatsapp-viewer/
- To process the JSON file into each statistic I wanted: A custom script I made
